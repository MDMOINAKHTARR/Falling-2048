# 🎮 Falling 2048

A Java-based puzzle game that combines the classic 2048 tile-merging mechanic with Tetris-style falling gameplay. Built using Java Swing, this project demonstrates real-time game logic, grid-based mechanics, and interactive UI handling.

## 🧩 Game Overview

In **Falling 2048**, tiles with values like 2, 4, and 8 fall from the top of the screen.  
Your goal is to **stack and merge matching numbers** to form higher values and increase your score.  
Use arrow keys to control the tile's movement and make strategic merges.

🟫 **Game ends when there's no room to spawn a new tile.**  
⚡ **Each 1000 points = new level + faster tile drops.**
